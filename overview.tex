\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data
integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.  Git allows
repository clones to act as fully functioning repositories complete with history
and full revision tracking capabilities that are not dependent on network access
or a central server.
